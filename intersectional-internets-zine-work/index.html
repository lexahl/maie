Whose imaginary is taken as an authority? Whose interests are being served? </p><p>The process of creating this work involved analyzing the text and asking questions, thinking about Ruha Benjamin’s book Race After Technology, Katherine Ye&rsquo;s essay Silicon Valley and the English Language, Sheila Jasanoff and Sang-Hyun Kim’s book Dreamscapes of Modernity, and more. This project started with tweets to support the analysis of the sociotechincal imaginary of meta’s (facebook’s) metaverse, but then I realized that the tweets and the language being used in them are also imaginaries.</p><p>This work will be published online (soon!) in a collaborative zine with MA students from the Creative Computing Institute and PhD students at the Oxford Internet Institute.</p><center><div><iframe src=https://instagram.com/p/CXHDI2YrVml/embed frameborder=0 allowfullscreen scrolling=no allowtransparency width=320 height=520></iframe></div></center><h3>v2 (Apr 2022)</h3><p><img src=/img/zine2.jpg alt="black and white zine artwork" title="who belongs on the moon? // who belongs in the future?"></p></article></main><footer id=footer><object type=image/png width=200 draggable=false data=img/fallback.png></object><br>>> Degree Details:<br>>> <a href=https://www.arts.ac.uk/creative-computing-institutes target=_blank>UAL Creative Computing Institute →</a><br>>> <a href=https://www.arts.ac.uk/subjects/creative-computing/postgraduate/ma-internet-equalities target=_blank>MA Internet Equalities →</a><br>>> 2021 - 2022 © Alexandria</footer></body></html>
