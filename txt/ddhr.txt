In April 2022 for the course Human Rights and computation I started a project called the "Digital Deconstruction of Human Rights". DDHR - digital deconstruction of human rights - is a text data project to enhance awareness of the unevenness of human rights in specific contexts, and their entanglements with corporations and technologies through time. This project critiques human rights as framed by the UN Declaration of Human Rights, the UDHR, from 1948. Through a collection of text data about human rights, the imagery and various contexts, this project encourages the viewer to question “who has power to declare rights?” and “who can claim rights?” in a critique on the uneven distribution of rights and the antiquity of certain rights around the world today. The project is below and is approximately 8000 words. 

While the UDHR is and has been used in liberatory movements and to work towards a fair, dignified, equal treatment of individuals and communities around the world, these same rights are a political tool that has also been used to justify imperialism, violence, and more. The UDHR can be seen as a political tool by its framing of the rights and freedoms of individuals in relation to the nation-state. For example, Article 9 states that “No one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest, detention or exile.” Here, and in many other rights from the UDHR, the nation-state is “paradoxically the perpetrator of human rights violations and the body through which rights and freedoms are given to people.” This project is a “deconstruction” of this framing by exploring the ideas that technologies, individuals, nature, and corporations can also be granters and violators of human rights. 

This project originated in February 2022 with the prompt to create a prototype of a data-driven artefact that explores bias in AI or other computational inequality. The Digital Deconstruction of Human Rights explores the social issues raised by human rights in the digital age using multiple text datasets. Over this process, I heard from family and friends about the "Freedom Convoy" protest in Canada, where people claim human rights violations for vaccine mandates and border-crossing rules. I heard about the Tigray War, the Russia-Ukraine war on Twitter, and I watched these topics, and their entanglements with human rights, take over the headlines and conversations in my circles. It became clearer that some voices are a lot louder than others when speaking about human rights, which led me to think about who can claim human rights, who is more human than who, and who and what can control human rights. 

Twitter text data in this project was "scraped" selectively. There is hate speech on Twitter, and it did not to be included in this project. Embedding harm such as racism, sexism, hate speech, and other biases is not a new issue with data-based projects. Specifically on Twitter, Microsoft's Tay chatbot, "TayTweets," was an example of what could go wrong with using data from Twitter. Context: “In 2016, Microsoft’s Racist Chatbot Revealed the Dangers of Online Conversation The bot learned language from people on Twitter—but it also learned values.”

Originally this project was going to generate “human rights” by fine-tuning GPT-2 to generate context relevant text, based on the data scraped from Twitter. However, as I continued to collected the data from Twitter and started playing around with text generation using GPT-2 and transformers, I noticed that some statements from Twitter and some statements generated with GPT-2 were very similar. Additionally, when reading some of the Twitter-claimed rights, I agreed with sentiment some of them (Everyone is entitled to health care, Source: Twitter, Date: 2/17/2022) and I noticed that many of the rights were supported by others. I understood support on Twitter as demonstrated by likes, retweets, and comments on the post. Another important consideration is that I had no way of knowing if a person authored the tweet or if a bot did. Because of the potenial overlap of computer generated statements, the fact that I could not know if a person had shared the tweet, and the  courious similarity, I decided to not continue with fine-tuning GPT-2 to generate text data.

The text data from Twitter, GPT-2, and UDHR was “cleaned,” meaning that it was modified for conformity and exportability, using Google Sheets. This tool was chosen because of my previous knowledge and experiences with Excel functions, the ease of export, and the way that I can share a viewable link publicly. 

Missing from this project are Tweets in languages besides English. While users from many places around the world can Tweet in English, many voices and opinions are not part of this project. Furthermore, all perspectives and voices that do not share specific views and statements about rights on Twitter are not included. These are some of the loud voices, but these voices often speak over others. As this project is to create a discussion about human rights, I hope it can create space for more perspectives and more voices to be listened to.

Context: Fourteen-hour shifts were common because delivery service providers wouldn’t allow drivers to return any packages from their routes and the pressure to meet delivery rates meant Meyers used a plastic bottle to go to the bathroom on a daily basis (source: https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/mar/11/amazon-delivery-drivers-bathroom-breaks-unions). But the fact that Amazon delivery drivers pee in bottles and coffee cups in their vans is not invented. It has been well-documented, and is a huge talking point among many delivery drivers. It is one of the most universal concerns voiced by the many Amazon delivery drivers around the country that Motherboard has interviewed. Delivery workers, who drive Amazon emblazoned vans, often deliver up to 300 packages a day on a 10 hour shift. If they take too long, they can be written up and fired. So spending time locating and using a bathroom is not always an option (source: https://www.vice.com/en/article/k7amyn/amazon-denies-workers-pee-in-bottles-here-are-the-pee-bottles).

ABOUT TWITTER TEXT DATA 
This data was collected from February 10, 2022 until March 27, 2022 for a total of 10 working hours. This text data was collected from twitter by searching for tweets in English that contain the exact words "Everyone has the right to", "All human beings are", and "Everyone is entitled to". The tweets that contained at least one of those sentence segments were then copied and pasted into an excel document. The entire tweet was not always copied, only the sentence of phrase containing one of those segments. Along with the raw text of the tweet, a link to the tweet the data was sourced from and the date in which the data was added to the spreadsheet was collected.

Many tweets were not included during this data collection process. Tweets that focused or mentioned a specific person or group of people were not included. Repeat tweets/statements were also not collected; this also excluded tweets that repeated any rights from the UDHR. These decisions were made by myself and, therefore, are biased by my positionality and experiences as to what could and and could not be seen as harmful.

As someone who has held roles working with data, I had the tools and skills to complete this data collection task. I also have had stable access to the internet when needed and a laptop computer with the required software. I did not require additional training or support to complete this data collection. In previous experiences working with data in a paid position, I have made CAD$20-$75, approximately GBP£12-£45, per hour. I was not paid for this project but could have billed around CAD$750, approximately GBP£450, for my labour.

However, my rate is not necessarily typical for data collection tasks. For example, on fiverr.com, a digital platform for freelance services, time and labour for data collection of this type can be hired for CAD$6.62, GBP£3.99, per hour. This work is done by "Virtual Assistants" located in Bangladesh, Pakistan, Indonesia, and around the world. I have not included the specific listings at this rate, but they can be found >here< on fiverr.com. 

My educational background does not determine my rate; many freelancers on fiverr.com hold similar or more relevant university credentials, a Bachelor of Science Degree. My experience in data-related roles does not determine my rate either. The freelancers on fiverr.com are highly experienced and, from what some users have described on the platform, have worked more hours with data collection and the relevant software than I ever have. Everyone, without any discrimination, has the right to equal pay for equal work. Does everyone, without any discrimination, have the right to equal pay for equal work?

ABOUT GPT-2 TEXT DATA
This text data was generated using a transformers model called GPT-2. Text generation is used for many things, from generating alt-text for images to creating Twitter bots. For those who can code, Twitter bots can be created using GPT-2 in only 100 lines of code (source: https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-make-a-gpt2-twitter-bot-8669df60e60a).

Text generation can also be used to spread misinformation. In the early pandemic, it was claimed that "Nearly Half Of Accounts Tweeting About Coronavirus Are Likely Bots" (source: https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/05/20/859814085/researchers-nearly-half-of-accounts-tweeting-about-coronavirus-are-likely-bots?t=1648479994148). Additionally, "Twitter Bots Are a Major Source of Climate Disinformation". They account for "25% of the total tweets about climate change on most days" (source: https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/twitter-bots-are-a-major-source-of-climate-disinformation/). Misinformation is a human rights issue, and text generation is entangled in this.

Context: The current blurring of fact and fiction impacts our voting patterns and political views, and there is much evidence to suggest that the spread of fake news through online media platforms is to blame. Furthermore, studies show that 40% of health news shared online is fake, with vaccines a big area of concern (source: https://www.humanrightspulse.com/mastercontentblog/fake-news-and-its-implications-for-human-rights).

ABOUT UDHR TEXT DATA
This text data was taken directly from the United Nations Web Page. The United Nations General Assembly ratified the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the UDHR in Paris, France, on the 10th of December, 1948. The United Nations was founded in 1945 after World War II and the UDHR was championed as a natural evolution of enlightened values. However, it can also be seen how this document emerged out of specific political and geopolitical contexts to push political goals, including preventing wars. Some may even share the view that some human rights are evolved along with capitalism.

The UDHR document was produced in 1948. This was 35 years before the internet in January 1, 1983, and 41 years before the World Wide Web in March 12, 1989. Since ratified, the world has changed drastically, while the rights remain the same.

The UDHR is "a common standard of achievements for all peoples and all nations" (source: https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights) and is used to bring equality and justice to people and communities around the world. These rights are essential and have been significant since 1948 for many people and communities. However, the rights that have been in the UDHR since 1948 still cannot be claimed by all peoples and all nations universally. This unevenness and outdatedness are what I want to draw attention to with this project. In the same we exist in contractions, human rights are essential and should not be disregarded but should also be challenged. All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. Are all human beings born free and equal in dignity and rights?

Here are 50 lines the UDHR text data:
