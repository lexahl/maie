At the Creative Computing Institute, I have explored methods for equitable technology design and challenged technology and societies' entanglements while incorporating disability, environmental, climate, and gender justice. 

My practice focuses on data and critically re-imagining and speculating diverse futures of technology and society through various digital mediums and materials.
