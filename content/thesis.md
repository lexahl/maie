### June 2022 <<thesis brainstorming>>

ideas + topics the thesis project relates too: data + sustainability + Land, equitable/fair/sustainable data practices and what it could look like. 
extension on data justice, technology design and sustainability. technology coexistence with nature. 
technology, human rights and Land + environments + survival.

1
* tech design and sustainability
* data centres
* planned obsolescence 
* design for human survival
* accessibility

2
* nature coexist with technology
* nature influence technology
* complexity
* nature x human, design and datafication
* human coexist with technology

3
* data, tech design
* care and technology, data
* reciprocity and tech, data 
* tech design, design justice

notes/feedback from peers:
    all 3 sections are different
    2 and 3 go well together - our relationship to tech and outselves is similar to our relationship to nature
    they could all link but could be lots
    care, coexistance, reciprocity seems to bring them together
    sounds like stuff i talk about which is good, could get deeper with this
    adam curtis - hypernormalization bbc iplay
    nature think about emergent design, biomimicry
    land and environment for survival
