notes/feedback:
    all 3 sections are different
    2 and 3 go well together - our relationship to tech and outselves is similar to our relationship to nature
    they could all link but could be lots
    care, coexistance, reciprocity seems to bring them together
    sounds like stuff i talk about which is good, could get deeper with this
    adam curtis - hypernormalization bbc iplay
    nature think about emergent design, biomimicry
    land and environment for survival
