extension on data justice, technology design and sustainability. technology coexistence with nature.
technology, human rights and Land + environments + survival.</p><p>P1
tech design and sustainability
data centres
planned obsolescence
design for human survival
accessibility</p><p>P2
nature coexist with technology
nature influence technology
complexity
nature x human, design and datafication
human coexist with technology</p><p>P3
data, tech design
care and technology, data
reciprocity and tech, data
tech design, design justice</p><p>notes/feedback:
all 3 sections are different
2 and 3 go well together - our relationship to tech and outselves is similar to our relationship to nature
they could all link but could be lots
care, coexistance, reciprocity seems to bring them together
sounds like stuff i talk about which is good, could get deeper with this
adam curtis - hypernormalization bbc iplay
nature think about emergent design, biomimicry
land and environment for survival</p></article></main><footer id=footer><object type=image/png width=200 draggable=false data=img/fallback.png></object><br>>> Degree Details:<br>>> <a href=https://www.arts.ac.uk/creative-computing-institutes target=_blank>UAL Creative Computing Institute →</a><br>>> <a href=https://www.arts.ac.uk/subjects/creative-computing/postgraduate/ma-internet-equalities target=_blank>MA Internet Equalities →</a><br>>> 2021 - 2022 © Alexandria</footer></body></html>
